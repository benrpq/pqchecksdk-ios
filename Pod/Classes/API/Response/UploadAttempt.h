/**
 *  This class encapsulates the object returned by PQCheck server in response to an attempt to selfie video.
 *
 *  The status of the attempt is given by `authorisationStatus`, if the status is:
 *
 *  1. SUCCESS, then that's the end of the authorisation;
 *  2. OPEN, then the user should be asked to record another selfie video reading the transcript given by `nextDigest`;
 *  3. TIMED-OUT, then the authorisation has failed and a new authorisation has to be created;
 *  4. CANCELLED, then the authorisation has been called by the user and a new authorisation has to be created.
