/**
 *  The class implements an authorisation representation.
 *
 *  When a user performs an operation that requires PQCheck, an authorisation has to be created in the first place. A new authorisation begins its life with OPEN state and may turn to SUCCESS state after a correct selfie video has been submitted. The transcript of what to read and the upload URL of the selfie video are all encapsulated in this class.
 *
 *  Each authorisation has a validity period, after which, the state will change to TIMED-OUT.
